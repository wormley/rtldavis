## rtldavis

### About this Repository

This repository is a fork of [https://github.com/bemasher/rtldavis](https://github.com/bemasher/rtldavis) for use with custom receiver modules. It has been modified in numerous ways.
1) Added EU frequencies
2) Handling of more than one concurrent transmitters.
3) Output format is changed for use with the weewx-rtldavis driver which does the data parsing. 


## Installation

#### Install packages needed for rtldavis

    sudo apt-get install golang git cmake librtlsdr-dev

#### Setup Udev Rules

Next, you need to add some udev rules to make the dongle available for the non-root users. First you want to find the vendor id and product id for your dongle.
The way I did this was to run:

    lsusb

The last line was the Realtek dongle:
    Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0bda:2838 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
    Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0bda:2838 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL2838 DVB-T

The important parts are "0bda" (the vendor id) and "2838" (the product id).

Create a new file as root named /etc/udev/rules.d/20.rtlsdr.rules that contains the following line:
    nano /etc/udev/rules.d/20.rtlsdr.rules
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bda", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2838", GROUP="adm", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="rtl_sdr"

With the vendor and product ids for your particular dongle. This should make the dongle accessible to any user in the adm group. and add a /dev/rtl_sdr symlink when the dongle is attached.

#### Get librtlsdr

    cd /home/pi
    git clone https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr.git
    cd librtlsdr
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

#### Change / create ~/profile

    sudo nano ~/.profile
    add at the end of the file:
    
    export GOROOT=/usr/lib/go
    export GOPATH=$HOME/work
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
    
#### Activate changed / new ~/profile
    source ~/.profile

#### Get the rtldavis package

    cd /home/pi
    go get -v github.com/lheijst/rtldavis

#### Compiling GO sources

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lheijst/rtldavis
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    go install -v .

#### Start program rtldavis

    $GOPATH/bin/rtldavis

#### Usage

Available command-line flags are as follows:

```
Usage of rtldavis:

  -tr [transmitters]
    	code of the stations to listen for: 
        tr1=1 tr2=2 tr3=4 tr4=8 tr5=16 tr6=32 tr7=64 tr8=128
        or the Davis syntax (first transmitter ID has value 0):
        ID 0=1 ID 1=2 ID 2=4 ID 3=8 ID 4=16 ID 5=32 ID 6=64 ID 7=128
        When two or more transmitters are combined, add the numbers.
        Example: ID0 and ID2 combined is 1 + 4 => -tr 5
        
        Default = -tr 1 (ID 0)

  -tf [tranceiver frequencies]
        EU or US
        Default = -tf EU

  -ex [extra loop_delay in ms]
        In case a lot of messages are missed we might try to use the -ex parameter, like -ex 200
        Note: A negative value will probably lead to message loss
        Default = -ex 0
 
  -fc [frequency correction in Hz for all channels]
        Default = -fc 0
        
  -ppm [frequency correction of rtl dongle in ppm]
        Default = -ppm 0
        
  -maxmissed [max missed-packets-in-a-row before new init]
        Normally you should set this parameter to 4 (-maxmissed 4). 
        During testing of new hardware it may be handy (for US equipment) to leave the default value of 51. 
        The program hops along all channels and present information about each individual channel. 
        Default = -maxmissed 51
        
  -u [log undefined signals]
        The program can pick up (i.e. reveive) messages from undefined transmitters, e.g. from a weather station near-by.
        De messages are discarded, but you may want to see on which channels they are received and how many.
        Default = -u false
```
