Problems with original frequency correction:
Applied error to the following hop.
 - Changed to apply correction based on frequency selected and expected
   transmitter.

Discriminated array does not match Quantized array so pkt.Idx can never work
 - Extended Discriminated array handling and size to match Quantized
   - Possibly slower due to moving slightly more data per block.
 - Changed algorithm to use preamble bits(0-15) which are 
   always an equal number of 0 and 1, so Discriminated output should average
   to 0.
 - Changed average to stride to match the same samples used in 
   quantization as we know those bits were properly decoded.
   - Reduces data used slightly
 - Switched to moving average without Ring Buffer.
   - Just because
 - Changed Discriminated to Freq Error calculation
   for new expected average of '0'
 - Added verbose debug for correction enablable at build time
   Outputs raw Discriminated values so we can make sure they match preamble
 - Added code to not remove the expected previous correction if AFC is 
   enabled, otherwise we'd stabilize at about 1/2 the needed correction
